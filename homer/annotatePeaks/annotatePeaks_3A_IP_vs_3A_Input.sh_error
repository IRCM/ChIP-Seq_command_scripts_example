	Genome = hg19
	Organism = human
	Effective Genome size set to hg19
	Will extract conservation information
	Will calculate CpG/GC content
	Will perform Gene Ontology analysis - output to directory = ../../../homer/annotatePeaks/3A_IP_vs_3A_Input/gene_ontology/
	Will perform Genome Ontology analysis - output to directory = ../../../homer/annotatePeaks/3A_IP_vs_3A_Input/genome_ontology/
		Warning - might want to set the genome size with -gsize (currently hg19)
	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 13103
		peakfile formatted lines: 0
		Duplicated Peak IDs: 0

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 13103
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!
