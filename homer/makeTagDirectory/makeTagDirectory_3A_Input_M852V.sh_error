	Optimizing tag files...
	Estimated genome size = 3094459136
	Estimated average read density = 0.012831 per bp
	Total Tags = 39705992.0
	Total Positions = 72267863
	Average tag length = 49.9
	Median tags per position = 0 (ideal: 1)
	Average tags per position = 0.089
	Fragment Length Estimate: 150
	Peak Width Estimate: 248
	Autocorrelation quality control metrics:
		Same strand fold enrichment: 1.0
		Diff strand fold enrichment: 1.2
		Same / Diff fold enrichment: 0.9

		Guessing sample is ChIP-Seq - may have low enrichment with lots of background
